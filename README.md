# Seven Fifty (Words) for Obsidian 📝
I agree with basically everything in this [thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/750-words/18000). It's been a few years so I thought, why not, I'll build this.

# How to use
## Commands
#### `Open Today's 750 Words`
- Opens the note associated with the current date
- If no notes exist creates the 750 words directory
- As you edit the words, the word count updates
> [!NOTE]
> The word count only updates when there are changes in the editor, so if the word count isn't accurate, make an edit then undo it

#### `View Writing Statistics`
- Generates (or updates) a *Writing Statistics 📊* file 
- Shows some stats, last 10 sessions, and writing calendar
